# Loosely based on a sketch by BÃ¡rbara Almeida
# https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/179567
# Here is a sketch that clearly demonstrates some of the most egregious parts of
# vanilla processing:-
# PVector is over complicated and overloads 2D and 3D functionality, cf Vec2D
# JRubyArt and propane which behaves as a 2D vector (cross product is a float)
# and can easily be used in chain calculations.

# Usage click on screen with mouse to generate a point, repeat as required
# to create a triangle, and the circumcircle will be drawn unless the points are
# collinear. Additional clicks erase the first point and add a new point. To
# demonstrate the stupid processing coordinate convention press 'c' or 'C', you
# will see the graph is inverted and origin y is top left, also demonstrates
# the collinearity test press space-bar to clear
