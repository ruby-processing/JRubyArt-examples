# Shared Drawing Canvas (Server)
# by Alexander R. Galloway. Translated to JRubyArt by Martin Prout
#
# A server that shares a drawing canvas between two computers.
# In order to open a socket connection, a server must select a
# port on which to listen for incoming clients and through which
# to communicate. Once the socket is established, a client may
# connect to the server and send or receive commands and data.
# Get this program running and then start the Shared Drawing
# Canvas (Client) program so see how they interact.
