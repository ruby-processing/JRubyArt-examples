# Boolean data is one bit of information. True or false. 
# It is common to use Booleans with control statements to 
# determine the flow of a program. In this example, when the
# boolean value "x" is true, vertical black lines are drawn and when
# the boolean value "x" is false, horizontal gray lines are drawn.

# In Ruby, false and nil are "falsy" ... they are the only things
# that will fail an "if" test. Absolutely everything else passes "if".
