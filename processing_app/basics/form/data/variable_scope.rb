# Variables may either have a global or local "scope". 
# For example, variables declared within either the
# setup or draw functions may be only used in these
# functions. Global variables, variables declared outside
# of setup and draw, may be used anywhere within the program.
# If a local variable is declared with the same name as a
# global variable, the program will use the local variable to make 
# its calculations within the current scope. Variables may be localized
# within classes, functions, and iterative statements.

# Please note that there are some changes on variable scope inside blocks

def draw_yet_another_line

  # instance variable "a" (returned by its getter function) which was 
  # set to the value 20 in setup.

# Ruby can add that getter function for you automatically:
# attr_reader :a

# And this would create a setter which will allow you to set "a" to a value ( "a = 123" )
# without using that "@" sign all the time:
# attr_writer :a

# Or you could just have Ruby add both at once with:
# attr_accessor :a
