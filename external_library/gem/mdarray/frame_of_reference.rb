    # Using each Triangle normal (N),
    # One of the Triangle's edges as a tangent (T)
    # Calculate a bi-normal (B) using the cross-product between each N and T
    # Note caps represent constants in ruby so we used N = nn, T = tt and
    # B = bb in the ruby code below

    # A picture helps
    # nice, sweet orthogonal axes

    #
    # N, T, B together give you a Frame of Reference (cute little local
    # coordinate system), based on each triangle. You can then take the
    # cylinder (or any vertices) and transform them using a 3 x 3 matrix to
    # this coordinate system. (In the matrix each column is based on N, T and
    # B respecivley.) The transform will handle any rotations and scaling, but
    # not the translation, but we can add another dimenson to the matrix to
    # hold the translation values. Here's what all this confusing description
    # looks like:

    #
    # Matrix :                               Vector :
    # |  N.x  T.x  B.x  translation.x  |      |  x  |
    # |  N.y  T.y  B.y  translation.y  |      |  y  |
    # |  N.z  T.z  B.z  translation.z  |      |  z  |
    # |  0    0    0    1              |      |  1  |

    # We add the extra row in the matrix and the 1 to each vector
    # so the math works. We describe the Matrix as 4 rows by 4 columns
    # and the vector now as a Matrix with 4 rows and 1 column.
    # When you multiply matrices the inner numbers MUST match, so:
    # [4 x 4] [4 x 1] is OK, but [4 x 4] [1 x 4] is NOT COOL.
    # see mat4.rb where we use MDMatrix to handle the multiplication for us

    nn = p[i].n
    tt = Vec3D.new(
      p[i].vecs[1].x - p[i].vecs[0].x,
      p[i].vecs[1].y - p[i].vecs[0].y,
