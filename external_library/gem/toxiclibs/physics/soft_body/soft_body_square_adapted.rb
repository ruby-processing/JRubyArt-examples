# This example is adapted from Karsten Schmidt's SoftBodySquare example
#
# <p>Softbody square demo is showing how to create a 2D square mesh out of
# verlet particles and make it stable enough to adef total structural
# deformation by including an inner skeleton.</p>
#
# <p>Usage: move mouse to drag/deform the square</p>
